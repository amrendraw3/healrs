Yes

= Can I delete my posts from frontend =

Yes

= Can I upload photo/image/video =
Yes

= I am having problem with uploading files =

= Why "Edit Post" page shows "invalid post id"? =
This page is for the purpose of editing posts. You shouldn't access this page directly.
First you need to go to the dashboard, then when you click "edit", you'll be
redirected to the edit page with that post id. Then you'll see the edit post form.
